## Introduction

The *European Social Survey* is a social scientific endeavour to map the attitudes, beliefs and behaviour patterns of the various populations in Europe. The data is open to everyone on the [European Social Survey website](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/). **Social Perception** makes use of this public-access data with the objective of analysing human convictions, thoughts, world conceptions, and how can these be modelled.

## Discoverings

Throughout the development of this project, I've come across a great deal of intelligible and very interesting insights that describe social attitudes towards different aspects of life, reaching the ulterior purpose of this venture, which is to **model the human thought/opinion** in a *theoretical playground*. You can have a look at the [research notebooks.](https://github.com/ivanachillee/social-perception/tree/main/notebooks)

# Social Perception: Modelling the human thought and social attitudes.

**Social Perception** is an open-source data science research project that focuses on discovering meaningful insights and modelling the human thought in a simplified way, making use of psychographic, sociodemographic, and viewpoint data from the European Social Survey (ESS) R8. <sub><sup>*_ESS Round 8: European Social Survey Round 8 Data (2016).

## Introduction

The *European Social Survey* is a social scientific endeavour to map the attitudes, beliefs and behaviour patterns of the various populations in Europe. The data is open to everyone at the [European Social Survey website](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/). **Social Perception** makes use of this public-access data with the objective of analysing human convictions, thoughts, world conceptions, and how can these be modelled with the use of modern data-manipulation techniques such as computarized statistical analytics and machine learning.

## Discoverings

Throughout the development of this project, I've came across a great deal of intelligible and very interesting insights that describe social attitudes towards different aspects of life, reaching the ulterior purpose of this venture, which is to **develop a bootstrap framework on how to understand and manipulate opinion, by making use of human beliefs and feelings** in a *theoretical playground*. You can have a look at the [research notebooks.](https://github.com/ivanachillee/social-perception/tree/main/notebooks)

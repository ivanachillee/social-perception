## Introduction

The *European Social Survey* is a social science initiative designed to map the attitudes, beliefs, and behavior patterns of populations across Europe. The data is freely available to all at the [European Social Survey website](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/). **Social Perception** utilizes this publicly accessible data to analyze human convictions, thoughts, worldviews, and the modeling of these elements.

## Discoveries

During the project's development, I have encountered numerous insightful and intriguing findings that depict social attitudes towards various aspects of life. These discoveries further the ultimate goal of this endeavor, which is to **model human thought/opinion** in a *theoretical framework*. You can explore these findings in the [research notebooks](https://github.com/ivanachillee/social-perception/tree/main/notebooks).
